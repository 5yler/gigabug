# Gigatron Motor Control Debugging Arduino Code

## ROS Debugging

![ROS Debugging Topics](LOOKATME.png)

## TODO
* fix optical encoder RPM calculation
* test ROS Jade version of `rosserial` 

## Observations
* power cycling the Arduino without re-uploading code leads to mixed success running `rosserial` when Arduino is only powered via USB
* using `nh.initNode()` when the Arduino is connected to the car does not work
 * is this because of lingering `Serial.println()` statements, or actually interfering with some functionality?

## Arduino Sketch Components

### `gigabug.ino`
The main Arduino sketch file. 
* ROS publishers and subscribers are set up here
* callbacks for ROS messages are defined here
* the `setup()` function creates an instance of the `Context` class, which is where the loop that you would expect in `loop()` happens

### `context.h` and `context.cpp`
This is where everything comes together and all the magic happens.

### `commander.h` and `commander.cpp`
Class definitions for the `Commander` class and its subclasses:
* `RCCommander` for remote control mode
* `JetsonCommander` for autonomous and semiautomatic mode

### `isr.h` and `isr.cpp`
Interrupts!

### `classes.h`
Header for the PID controller and three of the smaller classes dealing with hardware. 

### `pidcontroller.cpp`
Proportional, integral, and derivative controller. Used for steering and drive motors.

### `dcservo.cpp`
The `DCServo` class for the steering servo and associated potentiometer.

### `rcdecoder.cpp`
`RCDecoder` class that translates signal from the remote control receiver into velocity and steering angle.

### `speedsensor.cpp` 
`SpeedSensor` class for calculating speed based on Hall Effect sensors.

### How To Generate Custom ROS Message Libraries For Arduino

```
sudo apt-get install arduino arduino-core #installs arduino IDE
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino #installs Rosserial-arduino
mkdir ~/sketchbook/libraries #make libraries directory if it doesnâ€™t already exist
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py <ARDUINO_SKETCHBOOK>/libraries
cd ~/sketchbook; git clone https://github.com/5yler/gigabug.git
'''

## Getting it all to work

### Install the digitalWriteFast' library in the 'Sketchbook/libraries' folder
(https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/digitalwritefast/digitalWriteFast.zip)

### Install the 'ros_lib' library with gigatron wrappers in 'Sketchbook/libraries' folder
* Make sure you have the metatron repo cloned into a catkin workspace. For example: 'giga_ws/src/metatron'
* Run 'catkin_init_workspace' in the /src folder
* cd to 'giga_ws' and run 'catkin_make'
* From 'giga_ws' run 'source devel/setup.bash'. Add 'source ~/PATH/TO/giga_ws/devel/setup.bash' to your .bashrc so you don't need to run every time. 
* cd to your Arduino 'Sketchbook/libraries' folder and run 'rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .'. Your code should now compile!
